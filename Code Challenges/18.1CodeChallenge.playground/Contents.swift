// "Point reflection" or "point symmetry" is a basic concept in geometry where a given point, P, at a given position relative to a mid-point, Q has a corresponding point, P1, which is the same distance from Q but in the opposite direction.

// Task
// Given two points P and Q, output the symmetric point of point P about Q. Each argument is of the type Point. Output should be in the same format, giving the X and Y coordinates of point P1. You do not have to validate the input.

// Examples
// (0, 0) & (1, 1) => (2, 2)
// (2, 6) & (-2, -6) => (-6, -18)
